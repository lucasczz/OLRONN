\section{Introduction}
Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in various domains, with the choice of optimizer playing a crucial role in achieving outstanding results.
In the context of batch learning, where all data is available simultaneously, extensive research has been conducted to explore different optimizer choices and optimization techniques for deep learning architectures.
Numerous methods have emerged to effectively update the weights of these architectures.
However, the investigation of optimizer choices in online learning, where models must adapt to evolving data streams, remains relatively limited.

This paper aims to bridge this knowledge gap by investigating how the choice of optimizer changes when transitioning from batch learning to online learning scenarios. Specifically, we address the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item How does the choice for the optimizer change from batch to online learning?
	\item What are practical choices for gradient-based online training of deep architectures in online learning?
	\item Are adaptive optimization methods better suited in Online Deep Learning?
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}
For the first research question, we explore how the selection of an optimizer differs when moving from the traditional batch learning setting to the dynamic online learning scenario. We examine the suitability of various optimizer choices in online learning and their impact on model performance.

The second research questions investigates practical choices for gradient-based online training of deep architectures.
We analyze different optimization techniques and explore their effectiveness in adapting to evolving data streams while maintaining model performance.
The third research question focuses on the performance of adaptive methods in online deep learning scenarios.
These methods dynamically adjust the learning rate based on gradient characteristics, allowing models to adapt more effectively to changing data patterns. We compare the performance of adaptive methods against other optimization approaches to determine their suitability for online deep learning tasks.
Through our in-depth analysis and experimentation, we aim to enhance our understanding of optimizer choices in online deep learning.
By shedding light on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, and batch sizes, and comparing the effectiveness of adaptive methods, we aim to enable researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions when selecting optimization techniques for real-time learning tasks.

\begin{itemize}

	\item How does the choice for the optimizer change from batch to online learning?
	      -> Batch learning: goal maximize batch size for best performance -> suitable for online learning?
	      -> Learning Rate

	\item Are adaptive methods better suited in Online Deep Learning?
	      -> Table with results
\end{itemize}

Motivation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters when it comes to training deep learning models.
	\item A small learning rate causes slow convergence, while an excessive learning rate causes instability (observable in the form of oscillations) or even increases in the training objective.
	\item \citet{bengioPracticalRecommendationsGradientbased2012} goes as far as to say that out of all possible hyperparameters, if any, the learning rate is the one to be tuned.
	\item This applies arguably even more so to online learning. Unlike in batch learning, for instance, repeating the entire process if training diverges is infeasible, due to the restriction that previously observed data samples can, if at all, only be stored in small numbers.
	\item Furthermore, the trained model must be ready to predict at any given moment meaning that an inadequate learning rate has an immediate impact on the quality of generated predictions.
	\item In batch learning it is still common practice to determine the learning rate by running multiple training runs, beginning with a high learning rate and restarting the process with a lower learning rate every time the objective value diverges~\cite{bengioPracticalRecommendationsGradientbased2012}.
\end{itemize}

	\item In-depth analysis on the influence of the learning rate and batch size on the effectiveness of online stochastic gradient descent
	\item Experimental comparison of different SGD-based optimizers

\section{Learning Rate Scheduling}

In the following, we will briefly outline the most important differences between the influence of the learning rate of first order gradient-based optimization methods in streaming- and in conventional batch learning environments.

First order gradient-based optimization approaches like stochastic gradient descent and its derivatives aim to iteratively minimize the error of a DL model using only first order gradient information at each step $t$. We denote the gradient of the prediction error for a mini-batch of training samples $y_t, X_t \sim p_t$ with respect to model-parameters $\theta$ as
\begin{equation}
	g_t(\theta)   =   \nabla_{\theta} \mathcal{L}(y_t, f(X_t; \theta)),
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{L}$ represents a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy for classification- or mean squared error for regression tasks). Using this notation, the update performed by SGD with a constant learning rate $\eta$ at each iteration $t$ is given by
\begin{equation}
	\theta_{t+1}  = \theta_{t} - \eta \cdot g_t(\theta_t).
\end{equation}

Many previous works deal with the intricacies of SGD in the context of training deep architectures in a batch learning setting (see \citet{bengioPracticalRecommendationsGradientbased2012,bottouStochasticGradientDescent2012,Goodfellow-et-al-2016}).
The primary trade-off identified by these works when it comes to  the selection of an appropriate learning rate is that between the speed of convergence and the amount of stochasticity.
While increasing the learning rate speeds up convergence, it also increases stochasticity and therefore leads to the divergence of the training criterion beyond a certain threshold.
\Citet{smithBayesianPerspectiveGeneralization2018} for instance, found that when modelling SGD as a stochastic differential equation, the “noise scale” is directly tied to $\eta$~\cite{smithBayesianPerspectiveGeneralization2018}.
In biological terms, increasing the learning rate increases plasticity, whereas decreasing it increases stability. % Maybe remove? I like the biological analogy, but there are no sources supporting the claim. 


To get the best out of large and small values for $\eta$, a learning rate schedule $(\eta_1,\ldots,\eta_T)$, which assigns a learning rate to each update step $t \in 1,\ldots,T$ can be used.
It is for instance common to set a high learning rate initially and decrease it throughout the training process.
This ensures fast convergence and a higher level of noise at the start of training, which has been claimed to help SGD skip over sharp minima with poor generalization~\cite{hochreiterFlatMinima1997,chaudhariEntropySGDBiasingGradient2017}, while mitigating jumping around potential minima at later stages.
Some have likened this procedure to simulated annealing, which shifts its focus from exploration at high temperatures to exploitation once temperatures have sufficiently decreased~\cite{smithDonDecayLearning2018}.

A simple way to achieve such a schedule is to exponentially decay $\eta$ after each update by multiplying it with a factor $\gamma < 1$, although some practitioners have come to prefer schedules with sharper drop-offs like step schedules that decrease $\eta$ by a larger margin after a certain number of updates~\cite{smithDonDecayLearning2018}.
Other popular options include cyclic learning rate schedules which oscillate  $\eta$ between a base- and a maximum or minimum value over a predefined interval.
Some studies~\cite{smithCyclicalLearningRates2017, smithSuperConvergenceVeryFast2018a} have found cyclic schedules to significantly speed up the convergence of neural networks even when compared to adaptive techniques like Adam~\cite{kingmaAdamMethodStochastic2017b}.
\Citet{wuDemystifyingLearningRate2019b} provide a detailed analysis on the effect of learning rate policies like the aforementioned ones.

In contrast to the field of conventional batch learning, the impact of the learning rate in stream-based deep learning is a lesser studied issue. According to \citet{bifetMOAMassiveOnline2010} a machine learning model operating in such an environment must be able to
\begin{center}
	\begin{varwidth}{0.5\textwidth}
		\begin{description}
			\item[R1:] process a single instance at a time,\label{rq:single_instance}
			\item[R2:] process each instance in a limited amount of time,\label{rq:limited_time}
			\item[R3:] use a limited amount of memory,\label{rq:limited_memory}
			\item[R4:] predict at any time,\label{rq:predict_any_time}
			\item[R5:] adapt to changes in the data distribution.\label{rq:adapt_to_drift}
		\end{description}
	\end{varwidth}
\end{center}
These requirements lead to significant differences with respect to the problem of learning rate optimization compared to batch learning.
Nevertheless, only few studies on the impact and tuning of the learning rate in stream-based deep learning exist.


In batch learning, the task of finding an optimal schedule for $\eta$ can be defined as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:batch_lr_optim}
	\begin{alignedat}{3}
		& \!\min_{\eta_0, \ldots, \eta_T} & \, & \sum_{i=1}^{V}\mathcal{L}(y_i, f(X_i; \theta_T)) &    &                              \\
		& \text{s.t.}                     &    & X_i, y_i  \sim p^{(v)}                           & \  & \forall i \in {1, \ldots, V}
		,
	\end{alignedat}
\end{equation}
where $p^{(v)}$ is a distribution of validation data, usually made up of a dataset split off from the training dataset.
Verbally, learning rate optimization in batch learning aims to find a schedule $(\eta_0, \ldots, \eta_T)$ leading to parameter values $\theta_T$ at the end of a training run that in turn minimize the prediction error for validation data.

Under the requirements described above, however, we must define the task differently as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:stream_lr_optim}
	\begin{alignedat}{3}
		& \!\min_{\eta_0, \ldots, \eta_T} & \, & \sum_{t=0}^{T}\mathcal{L}(y_t, f(X_t; \theta_{t-1})) &    &                               \\
		& \text{s.t.}                     &    & X_t, y_t  \sim p_t                           & \  & \forall t \in {1, \ldots, T}.
	\end{alignedat}
\end{equation}
Compared to Problem~\eqref{eq:batch_lr_optim}, the most apparent difference is that there is no separate validation data.
Instead, due to Requirement~\ref{rq:predict_any_time}, the goal is to minimize $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to the next instances $X_{t+1}, y_{t+1}$ at each timestep $t$.
This means that in contrast to Problem~\eqref{eq:batch_lr_optim}, not only the final parameters $\theta_T$ but every parameter configuration $\theta_t$ in the entire trajectory contributes equally to the objective.
Therefore, speed of convergence is of much larger importance in the streaming setting, whereas the performance of the final parameters $\theta_T$ has relatively little impact.
Since memory is limited (Requirement~\ref{rq:limited_memory}), it is also not possible to continue training on previously observed data as long as $\mathcal{L}$ decreases, which puts an even greater emphasis on quick adaptation.
Another difference to conventional batch learning is that the distribution $p_t$ of the data stream might, and in practice most likely will, be subjected to change in the form of concept drift over time.
Under such circumstances, the optimal parameter values $\theta^*$ move throughout the progression of the stream increasing the distance to the model parameters.

Since the theoretically optimal learning rate $\eta^*$ is proportional to the quadratic distance between initial and optimal parameters $||\theta_1 - \theta^*||^2$ (albeit under some constraints like the absence of noise)~\cite{carmonMakingSGDParameterFree2023}, it should be larger when concept drift occurs.

Based on this notion, \citet{kunchevaAdaptiveLearningRate2008} introduced an adaptive schedule that updates the learning rate using
\begin{equation}
	\eta_{t+1} = \eta_t^{1+(\mathcal{L}_t - \bar{\mathcal{L}}_{t-1})},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{L}_t$ represents the loss for the current sample, and $\bar{\mathcal{L}}_{t-1}$ a rolling mean of past losses.
By doing so, \citet{kunchevaAdaptiveLearningRate2008} increases in loss lead to increases in the learning rate and vice versa.
While this approach seems intuitively sound, it bears a high risk of $\eta$ increasing indefinitely, since increases in loss caused by an excessive learning rate would lead to a feedback loop.

We therefore propose a simple adaptation to popular decaying learning rate schedules that operates in a fixed value range and increases the model's plasticity when needed by resetting $\eta$ to its original value if a concept drift has occurred.
To this end we apply an ADWIN drift detector~\cite{bifetLearningTimeChangingData2007} to the underlying model's prequential loss to efficiently detect drifts.
While this does not allow for a continuous adaptation like the technique by \citet{kunchevaAdaptiveLearningRate2008} and might therefore be less suited for more subtle drift, it offers more reliability since the initial learning rate cannot be exceeded.

A popular type of approach for drift-aware learning rate scheduling in previous work is meta-learning, that aims to optimize $\eta$ with an additional optimization process.
For instance, \citet{velosoHyperparameterSelftuningData2021} and \citet{fekriDeepLearningLoad2021} use Bayesian optimization while \citet{zhangPOLAOnlineTime2021a} use a secondary gradient descent procedure to estimate the optimal learning rate at each timestep.
Since these methods require multiple forward passes through the network to be trained, they incur more computational overhead than most other first order optimization techniques, limiting their usefulness in often times performance critical streaming applications, which is why we excluded them from our evaluations.
Furthermore, several drift-adaptive optimizers were developed for specific areas of application such as time series forecasting~\cite{miyaguchiCograConceptDriftAwareStochastic2019}, federated learning~\cite{canonacoAdaptiveFederatedLearning2021} and recommender systems~\cite{ferreirajoseADADRIFTAdaptiveLearning2020}. 
Due to our focus for the present work being general data stream applications, we did not further investigate these techniques either. 

Concept drift also complicates the tuning of $\eta$, since even if data is available beforehand drift would eventually cause the stream to diverge from the distribution of data used for tuning.
In our experiments we investigate to which extent this effect impairs learning rate tuning on data available prior to deployment of a stream-based neural net. In this context we propose simple adaptations to the standard approach of learning rate tuning.

In a conventional batch learning setting, the 


\section{Parameter-Free Optimizers}

Due to the high computational cost of conventional learning rate tuning, several Parameter-free variants of SGD that eliminate the learning rate entirely have been developed.
- schaul et al.
- orabona et Al.
- ...

However, all these optimizers target batch learning scenarios, and therefore don't explicitly account for concept drift, making it unclear which of these approaches is suitable for stream-based learning.
Previous work on parameter-free optimization of online deep learning models is rather limited, and mostly focused on specific applications.
-Recommender systems
-federated learning

\section{Adaptive Optimizers}\label{sec:adaptive_optims}

In the case of adaptive approaches like SGD with momentum~\cite{rumelhartLearningRepresentationsBackpropagating1986a}, AdaGrad~\cite{duchiAdaptiveSubgradientMethods2011} or Adam~\cite{kingmaAdamMethodStochastic2017b} the learning rate also varies with respect to individual model parameters, in which case
\begin{equation}
	\eta_t \in \mathbb{R}^{D} \qquad \forall t \in 0,\ldots,T.
\end{equation}
For SGD with momentum,
\begin{equation}
	\eta_t = \alpha \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{t} \beta^{t-i} \cdot \frac{g_i}{g_t}
\end{equation}

We ran prequential evaluations using basic SGD with variable batch sizes and learning rates for synthetic data streams with and without incremental concept drift, the results of which are displayed in \Cref{fig:batch_size_lr}. For static data, the average prequential accuracy over the entire stream gradually improves when moving up from an inadequately low learning rate until a certain point where training begins to diverge and performance consequently crashes. Based on our results, there seems to be an inverse relationship between batch size and both the optimal learning rate and the optimal accuracy, with larger batch sizes seemingly increasing the risk of divergence.

% The primary cause of this relationship can be seen in \Cref{fig:trajectory_batch_sizes_0.5_lr}, which depicts the trajectories of parameters of two identical MLPs trained on a bivariate data stream using batch sizes of either 4 or 16 samples. With a batch size of 16, the model has to “wait” four times longer until it receives new gradient information than the one trained with a batch size of 4. As a result, the gradient information gained from each sample on average becomes less recent and therefore less accurate with a larger batch size. Example: in \Cref{fig:trajectory_batch_sizes_0.5_lr}

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}


This effect is much stronger in the presence of concept drift as the results for RBF Incremental show.

<-could be explained by the fact that the presence of concept drift exacerbates the gradient stochasticity caused by the delay between observation and learning of samples.
