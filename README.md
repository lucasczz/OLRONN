# Learning Rate Optimization in Online Deep Learning 

To reproduce the experiments: 

1. Create new anaconda environment with `conda env create -n lodl --file environment.yaml`
2. Activate environment: `conda activate lodl`
3. Run experiments with `python3 schedule.py ; python3 optimizers.py ; python3 pretune.py ; python3 model_sizes.py`
4. Generate plots and tables with notebooks located in `/notebooks`
